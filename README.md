<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

<h3 align="center">Welcome to my GitHub page! Here you will find my projects that I procrastinate on constantly.</h3>
<br>

#### Coding Languages I'm currently learning:

🐍 Python
  -> The language I have a basic grasp on, better than the other two at least. Now experimenting with more intermediate-level Python, even though I get lost easily.

📊 R
  -> Starting a new language and experimenting with data science! I'm still doing the basics.

🍵 Javascript
  -> The second language I learned, not as good as the first, but hey it's a start.

☕️ Java
  -> I only have a basic understanding of Java; I tried to learn this a year ago, but never carried on with it.

<br>
Am I good at any of the languages above? Not at all, I'm still learning.
